# React + Vite

This project recreates the secretMessageMath project using React.

The intention is for the user to input a message or get a random quote and turning into a secret message using multiplication and or division.

It should allow the user to input the type of math, the times tables used, and a message and will return the encoded message and a legend. 

It will also feature a printer friendly button to allow for better printing.

It will check the user's input to see if the message is right.
